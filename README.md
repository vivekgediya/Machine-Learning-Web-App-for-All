# Machine-Learning-Web-App-for-All

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps - so let’s get started!

Make sure that you have Python 3.6 - Python 3.8 installed.

Install Streamlit using PIP and run the ‘hello world’ app:

---> "pip install streamlit"
---> streamlit hello

That’s it! In the next few seconds the sample app will open in a new tab in your default browser.

Still with us? Great! Now make your own app in just 3 more steps:

Open a new Python file, import Streamlit, and write some code

Run the file with:

" streamlit run [filename] "

When you’re ready, click ‘Deploy’ from the Streamlit menu to share your app with the world!

Now that you’re set up, let’s dive into more of how Streamlit works and how to build great apps.

Introduction.py file has some basic syntex and fuction that works in streamlit.
1.py file has facilities to directly select 3 dataset which are directly imported and loaded from SciKit-Learn.
2.py file is the main mini prject file, in which user can upload any dataset adn perform EDA, Some visualization and model selection according to dataset and prefrable algorithm. various model gives various accuracy according to dataset and given parameter.
